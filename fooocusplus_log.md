# 1.0.0

* removed the irrelevant Fooocus and Simple version information. FooocusPlus does not synchronize with either of them
* removed legacy upstream references and moved the master subfolders to a new masters parent folder
* like mainline Fooocus, there are now two metadata schemes: "Fooocus" and "A1111". The confusing "Simple" label is gone
* if an image is stored with A1111 metadata, the Apply Metadata button is disabled instead of creating an error
* added Torch, CUDA and xformers data to System Information, under the Extras tab
* fixed a bug that prevented reinstallation of Torch if its folder was not found
* the various master folders are now subfolders of the new "masters" folder
* by default, all presets except for SD1.5 now use a 0*0 aspect ratio, meaning that it does not have any effect
* but as before, if a valid aspect ratio is set in a preset it overrides the current UI setting
* as presets are changed, by default the UI setting for aspect ratio does not change
* there are now four sets of aspect ratios defined in config.txt, the Standard, Shortlist, SD1.5, and PixArt templates
* the default settings for these templates are used for initial values but they do not override setting changes in the UI
* by default FooocusPlus starts with the Shortlist template, a Standard template that is simplified to only 15 values
* this default can be changed using the "enable_shortlist_aspect_ratios" config.txt setting
* the UI can toggled between Shortlist and Standard templates with the "Use the Aspect Ratio Shortlist" checkbox
* the SD1.5 presets change the aspect ratio display to the SD1.5 template
* when PixArt Sigma is introduced, a preset will select the PixArt template
* when switching between presets the UI attempts to keep the currently selected aspect ratio, and width and height too
* introduced and tested the "experimental" SDXL 1280*1280 aspect ratio, available from the Standard template
* introduced both Preset Categories and Presets dropdowns under the Settings tab
* the Preset Categories are: Alternative, Fantasy, Favorite, Flux1D, Flux1S, General, Illustrative, LowVRAM, Pony, Realistic & SD1.5
* the Category structure is duplicated to the User Directory. Changes in this directory will update the working preset folder
* the Categories are actually folders. If a preset file is located in a folder it will show up in that category
* presets can be stored in more than one category (folder) if desired
* the Make New Preset button, under the Extras tab, saves the current settings to a new preset, stored in the User Directory structure
* if the new preset is given the same name as a built-in one it will override it
* if the Random category is selected a random preset is chosen
* all presets may be displayed at once if the All category is selected
* the Current Preset is now listed just below the Generate button
* if Favorites is checked (the default) the favorite presets are shown in a horizontal menu bar located above the main canvas
* the current preset is now stored in the log
* FooocusPlus starts with the Default preset, unless low VRAM is detected in which case it starts with 4GB_Default
* the VRAM 4GB_Default preset can also be set by the config.txt "default_low_vram_presets" option
* added a config.txt option and checkbox to "Show Newest Images First" in the log. If this is off the newest images are last
* the Flux base models are recategorized into the FluxDev and FluxSchnell folders
* fixed a strange bug in which the "Specific Seed" value was being trashed when changing presets
* fixed a bug with SuperPrompter, the Wildcard Panel and the Sampler selector
* subject to testing, this version provisionally supports NVIDIA 50xx video cards
* temporarily removed several Wildcard files that need improvement

# 0.9.8 Dev

* initialized the UserDir folder: its location defaults to the repo's parent
* UserDir contains the models, master & user presets, startup batch, startup & control images, and wildcards folders
* the UserDir also contains config.txt and config_modification_tutorial.txt, torch_base.txt, and the Random Prompt master and user topic folders
* config.txt now contains all the settings listed in config_modification_tutorial.txt, making changes much easier
* startup_batch now holds all the optional batch files, besides the default run_FooocusPlus.bat
* master_presets is a copy of the same folder in the repo, for user reference only
* user_presets is designed for custom modifications of the master presets and presets saved within the UI
* during runtime, presets are loaded from the scratchpad presets folder within the repo, which is dynamically stocked
  from master_presets and then overwritten with the contents of user_presets
* this system enables any master preset to be superceded by a user preset, reducing potential preset bloat
* accessed from the Extras tab, the Make New Preset button enables creation of a preset based on the current parameters
* removed "auto" model support in presets, a confusing & unnecessary "feature"
* "Read Wildcards in Order" is now grouped with the wildcard dropdowns and called "Generate Wildcards in Order"
* renamed "Random" to "Random Seed" and "Fixed Seed" to "Specific Seed" (it is not really fixed because it still increments)
* moved "Disable Seed Increment" to just above "Specific Seed" and renamed it "Freeze Seed"
* introduced "Seed Increment Skip" for large random increments, called "Extra Variation", placed directly below "Random Seed"
* all four seed options now have descriptive help messages
* all UI references to OneButtonPrompt are now called "Random Prompt" and its "Presets" are called "Topics"
* removed more offensive text from Random Prompt, resolving some problems with Waifu's and Husbando's operation
* cleaned up the files and coding related to Random Prompt that caused the creation of ghost directories in the repo.
* removed superfluous Random Prompt and SuperPrompt controls in the Extras section
* the Random Prompt Topics dropdown menu is now alpha-sorted
* the newly labeled "Create a New Topic" option now operates a dropdown Save Topic group with improved formatting and help
* the same system used for user preset control also applies to user topics, allowing for easy addition and removal of topics
* the Superprompter folder is now correctly rebuilt if it is deleted
* corrected the path for the full SD3.0 medium base model, with accessories
* python_embedded version control now only applies to Windows platforms because other platforms do not use python_embedded
* updated many more Python libraries and removed Torch and its five related dependencies from the library
* Torch and its dependencies are now dynamically installed according to the user's operating system and hardware
* this dynamic system uses Torchruntime and the Torch version is recorded in torch_base.txt in UserDir
* added the Flux_BlackColor_SaMay.safetensors & FluxDFaeTasticDetails.safetensors to the built-in LoRAs
* added the Flux AntiBlur.safetensors & Hyper-FLUX.1-dev-8steps-lora.safetensors to the Starter Pack LoRAs
